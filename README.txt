C# extension methods to support export of File Geodatabase geometries to GeoJSON, WKT and others.

Project requires the Esri File Geodatabase API to be installed. It is currently built for x86 on the .Net Framework 4 and has been tested with the Esri File Geodatabase API 1.2 (VS2010).

Currently, only support for GeoJSON export for some geometry types has been implemented.
